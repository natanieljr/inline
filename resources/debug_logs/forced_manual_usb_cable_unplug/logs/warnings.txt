2015-10-01 16:31:22.664 WARN  org.droidmate.exploration.Exploration    ! Encountered exception during the exploration of org.droidmate.fixtures.apks.monitored after already obtaining some exploration output.
2015-10-01 16:32:22.884 WARN  org.droidmate.common.SysCmdExecutor      The command with description "Executing adb (Android Debug Bridge) to clear logcat output." executed for 60 seconds. The execution time was +- 100 milliseconds of the execution timeout. Reaching the timeout might be the cause of the process returning non-zero value. Try increasing the timeout (by changing appropriate cmd line parameter) or, if this doesn't help, be aware the process might not be terminating at all.
2015-10-01 16:32:24.025 WARN  org.droidmate.frontend.DroidmateFrontend DroidMate run finished, possibly prematurely, because a (subtype of) Throwable was propagated to main method. See previous logs for details on the Throwable.
