About InstrumentationJava:
- The InstrumentationJava is based on the original Instrumentation project from Philipp as follows: 
  1. first it was created by creating a new Java project in IntelliJ and copying only the /src with .java files from the original Instrumentation.
  2. then an "instrumentation.jar" artifact was added, with default settings.
  3. then I applied my modifications to the source: bug fixes, etc.
  
  WARNING this lib is currently NOT being used due to jni error: see emails to Philipp on Feb 3, 2015.
  
  If it would be used, then it would have to be copied to:
  C:\my\local\repos\chair\droidmate\dev\droidmate\projects\monitor-generator\monitor-apk-scaffolding\libs
  C:\my\local\repos\chair\droidmate\dev\apk_fixtures_src\InstrumentedApkFixture\libs
