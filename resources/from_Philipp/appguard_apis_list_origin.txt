I asked Philipp for current AppGuard APIs list. He has sent me an email at 15 May 2015 20:48 to jamrozik@st.cs.uni-saarland.de with

MonitorInitalizer.java. Turns out this file is already present in an email he sent me at 11 Aug 2015 20:19 to jamrozik@st.cs.uni-saarland.de.

Contents of it can be found in: C:\my\local\repos\chair\droidmate\resources\from_Philipp\Instrumentation_wrappers_11_Aug_2015
and the file in:
C:\my\local\repos\sechair\droidmate-private\resources\from_Philipp\Instrumentation_wrappers_11_Aug_2015\appguard-monitor\appguard-monitor\src\main\java\com\srt\appguard\monitor\MonitorInitializer.java

I extracted the appguard_apis.txt from the MonitorInitalizer.java using some manual processing.
