README by Konrad Jamrozik.

- The projects here were originally copied from projects kept in 
<repo>\droidmate_external_resources\from_Philipp\appguard\srcs\appguard-standalone.zip
   
- The appguard-standalone has a jar build artifact defined that is placed directly in the dm apk-inliner project as a resource. 
  Note that the appguard-standalone is an inliner, and it requires all the appguard-standalone-* projects to build.
