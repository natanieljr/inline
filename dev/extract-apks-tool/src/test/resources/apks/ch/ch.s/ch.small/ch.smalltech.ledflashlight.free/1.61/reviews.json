They even offset the cursor so that when you're choosing a color from the palette for the screen light, your finger isn't in the way. Very smart, thank you. My only complaint is that the widget doesn't just turn on your front flash, like I'd prefer, it opens the app on your screen. I'd like the widget to be a simple on/off switch.",
